Please streamline your openvpn configs by including your TLS and CA certificates within you .ovpn file.

Additionally please also include the auth file in your ovpn configs.

Your ovpn files should have this structure at the end of them

auth-user-pass /var/www/html/openvpn/auth
key-direction 1
<tls-auth>
#
# 2048 bit OpenVPN static key
#
-----BEGIN OpenVPN Static key V1-----
Key here
-----END OpenVPN Static key V1-----
</tls-auth>

<ca>
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
CA Cert(s) here
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
</ca>
